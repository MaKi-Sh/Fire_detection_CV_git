#Running CVAT Locally and Sharing Globally with ngrok

This guide explains how to start CVAT using Docker and share it over the internet using ngrok.

---

## Step 1. Clone the CVAT repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat
cd cvat
```

---

## Step 2. Start CVAT with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check that containers are running:

```bash
docker ps | grep cvat
```

Now open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to confirm CVAT is working.

---

## Step 3. Expose CVAT globally with ngrok

Run:

```bash
ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 8080
```

ngrok will print a forwarding address, for example:

```
Forwarding   https://abcd-1234.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

That `https://…ngrok-free.app` link is your global CVAT address.
Share it with collaborators anywhere in the world.

---

## Step 4. Stop CVAT

To stop ngrok, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal where it’s running.

To stop CVAT containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

✅ CVAT now runs locally with Docker, and ngrok makes it accessible worldwide over HTTPS without any router configuration.
